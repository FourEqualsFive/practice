<H1>About Us</H1>

<P> I'm just tryna mess around with Git for some quick practice before I have to use it for a real project. I said years ago that I was going to start doing this for my own backups, like my DND notes and stuff, but that never ended up happening. Well, it kind of did, but I only really used the windows desktop version, which is super easy. I'll be remoting into client servers where that stuff ain't available now, so I need to practice doing this with just terminal commands. Anyway that's my story--peace out doods.
