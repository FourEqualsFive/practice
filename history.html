<H1>History</H1>

<P>I went to Humber College for electronics technology, then worked in AV installations for a year. After that, I worked in sales for a PCB manufacturer based in China, before realizing that I wanted to get more into the technical side of the industry, and it would be hard to do so with only a college-level education. I returned to school at Lakehead University and earned my Bachelor of Engineering, then quickly found a job at a small startup, where I worked as the principle hardware design engineer. I learned a lot at my first job out of university, but ultimately I felt that it would be better to work under senior engineers with more experience in order to gain an understanding of best practices in the industry. I was hired onto Accenture's silicon services group in 2022, and I'll be rolling onto my first project next week! Yay! :)
